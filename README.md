## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### Continued development

Writing vanilla CSS and HTML is just too hard, not the work itself and the complexity but the feeling you get like you are wasting your time is just making this harder than it has to be. Try to enjoy it. If it help there are customers out there who prefers vanilla code, and if you do not have any experience like me, even trying to convert a simple Figma design to vanilla HTML, CSS will be really hard. Like hundreds of lines of code, whole mess.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Great place if you are too lazy to find the css attribute you are looking for.
